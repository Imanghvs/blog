# blog
A simple blog with an admin panel to make new posts, an index page to see all the posts,
and a comments page that shows all the comments.
Note that all the photos are the same. We don't have a server to upload photos, so we used a photo statically.
Of course the app is designed so that you feel the upload process.

## dependencies
In this project I used Vue.js along with Nuxt and Vuetify
